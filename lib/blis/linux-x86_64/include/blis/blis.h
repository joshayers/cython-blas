// linkable from the outside. But when compiling with -fvisibility=hidden, all

// with that setting overridden only for function prototypes or variable
// declarations that are annotated with BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS.

// compute in b), a and x would normally be typecast to b so that all
// operands are in the computation precision (namely, bfloat), but since
// our reference implementation implements bfloat flops in terms of float
// flops, all operands would need to be typecast back to s anyway just so
// the computation can take place. This means that a and x were truncated
// down to bfloat (and thus lost precision) somewhat unnecessarily. Instead,
// what could happen is that a and x remain in s, y is typecast to s,
// computation would take place in s, and then the result is truncated to
// bfloat on output to y. These macros substitute certain static function
// calls to be the equivalent calls that would cast to float instead of
// bfloat.
